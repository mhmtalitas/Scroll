Zero-Knowledge Proof
Homework 2

Homework: Creating a Decentralized Application (dApp) Idea
Purpose and Functionality
Idea: Digital Identity Verification

Purpose: To enable users to securely verify and share their digital identities. Users can access certain services without revealing their full identity details.

How it Works:

Users upload their identity information to the dApp.
The information is encrypted and stored in a decentralized manner.
Users verify their identity for accessing specific services.
Service providers grant access based on the verification result.
Scenario 1: Using Scroll
Advantages:

High Scalability: Handles more transactions quickly.
Low Transaction Costs: More affordable for users.
Disadvantages:

Less Decentralization: Being a newer technology, it might have fewer nodes.
Limited Adoption: Smaller user base and ecosystem compared to Ethereum.
Scenario 2: Using Ethereum
Advantages:

Large User Base: Extensive community and developer support.
Mature Ecosystem: Well-established and secure.
Disadvantages:

High Transaction Costs: More expensive to perform transactions.
Scalability Issues: Slower transaction speeds due to network congestion.
Preference and Justification
Choice: Scroll

Justification: Scroll is preferred due to its high scalability and low transaction costs, which are crucial for ensuring a seamless and cost-effective user experience. The ability to handle a large number of identity verifications quickly and affordably makes Scroll an ideal choice for this dApp.
