Part 1: Create Your Own Analogy
Analogy: Withdrawing Money from an ATM

Imagine you want to withdraw money from a bank ATM. The bank wants to verify that you have sufficient funds in your account without revealing your exact balance.

You insert your card into the ATM and enter your PIN.
The bank uses a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to verify that you have enough funds, without revealing your exact balance.
The ATM dispenses the money based on this verification.
In this way, you prove that you have sufficient funds without disclosing your account balance.

Part 2: Identify A Problem
Problem: Online Credit Score Verification

A person wants to verify their credit score when applying for a financial service, but they do not want to disclose their full financial details. This is a scenario where privacy is crucial during the credit score verification process.

Part 3: Integrating ZKP
Solution: ZKP for Credit Score Verification

Using ZKP, a person can prove that their credit score is above a certain threshold without revealing the exact score. The financial service provider can verify that the person's credit score is sufficient while keeping the person's full financial history private.

This method ensures both privacy and trust in the verification process.
